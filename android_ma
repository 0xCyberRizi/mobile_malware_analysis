## Introduction

Android malware represents a significant threat in the realm of cybersecurity, with adversaries continually evolving their tactics. This repository aims to provide insights into the static and dynamic analysis methodologies employed to uncover the behaviors and functionalities of Android malicious applications.

## Static Analysis Techniques

Static analysis involves scrutinizing the code and structure of an application without executing it. Key techniques include:

- **Decompilation**: Converting the application's bytecode back into source code.
- **Manifest Analysis**: Inspecting the AndroidManifest.xml file for permissions and components.
- **Code Review**: Manually analyzing the source code for suspicious patterns and functions.
- **Resource Analysis**: Examining resources such as images and strings for hidden content.

## Dynamic Analysis Techniques

Dynamic analysis involves executing the application in a controlled environment to observe its behavior. Common techniques include:

- **Emulation**: Running the application in an emulated environment to monitor its interactions.
- **API Hooking**: Intercepting and logging API calls made by the application during runtime.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Monitoring communication between the application and external servers.
